This is just a quick hack done in an evening. There's no license for my code,
do what ever you want with it. NO WARRANTIES whatsoever.
As for the Nyan graphics and sounds... I believe this little fun project to
be in the spirit of the original idea and hopefully be okay with the copyright
holders (if there are any). If not, just send me a mail (andi@splitbrain.org)
and I'll take it down.
